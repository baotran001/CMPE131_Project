Since we are building a messaging application, it is most important that we keep our user's privacy in mind.
The account information and messages by the user must be protected through a password system. As engineers we
strive to innovate and improve something about our society. Creating messaging websites like ours will 
lessen the need for in person interaction. This is useful in light of the recent pandemic but also for the 
environment in general. This makes people less reliant on cars and other transportation vehicles that will
pollute the air. With websites like ours becoming more integral to society, society as a whole will 
reduce their carbon footprint and slow down climate change which is a global threat. Of course the only
risk of this application would be the security. That's why it is our responsible to keep the user's password
and messages protected from potential threat.
